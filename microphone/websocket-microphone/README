An example of the local webserver taking audio from microphone and
sending it to the clients around. Good for centralized speech recognition
on the desktop where you might have multiple clients consuming
recognition results.

Websockets protocol might not be optimal here, something like MQTT might
work as well. Subject to redesign.
